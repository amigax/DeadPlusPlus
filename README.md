DeadPlusPlus (& The Dead Walk) By Gareth Murfin (www.garethmurfin.co.uk)
====================================================

Dead++ is a 2D games design tool written in Java. Initially I created this in order to make a zombie game I designed called THE DEAD WALK (which comes with DeadPlusPlus). To cut a long story short, after around 4 years of part time development, I gave up due to lack of funds, and a falling out with my artist. 
This toolset, engine and the game itself, represent over 2000 hrs of hard work, and the art around 700 or 800 hrs. For years this tool was a labour of love, imagine it as a Unity2D of sorts - an unfinished one :)..

There's still a lot to do to finish this and improve on it (and the code is downright wacky all over no doubt, this was built over years, in various countries around the world I hacked away at it in hotel rooms :)), but rather than allow it languish on my hard drive forever, I thought, I might as well put it out there and see what happens.

You can see some screenshots of this tool on my blog here: http://freelanceandroid.wordpress.com/2000/09/10/personal-projects-the-dead-walk-genocide-dolphins/
