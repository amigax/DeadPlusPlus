DeadPlusPlus by Gareth Murfin (www.garethmurfin.co.uk)
====================================================

Dead++ is a 2D games design tool written in Java. Initially I created this in order to make a zombie game I designed called THE DEAD WALK. To cut a long story short, after around 4 years of part time development, I gave up due to lack of funds, and a falling out with my artist. 
This toolset, engine and the game itself, represent over 2000 hrs of hard work, and the art around 700 or 800 hrs. For years this tool was a labour of love, imagine it as a Unity2D of sorts - an unfinished one :).. 

You can see some screenshots of this tool on my blog here: http://freelanceandroid.wordpress.com/2000/09/10/personal-projects-the-dead-walk-genocide-dolphins/
